Monday, March 31:
    * Backpropagation for Stochastic activation layers
        * stochstic_activation, config, network, linear_layer, optimizer
        * You may want to redo your linear_layer backprop in the case it is better
        * keep shit tight, use all configuration variables
    * *CFG in all necessary method signatures

Tuesday, April 1:
    * Backpropagation for all layers, ensure that config.c is used
    * Optimizers from config.h
        * adam
        * sgd with momentum
        * RMSprop
        * SGLD

Wednesday, April 2:
    * Priors and Posteriors for all layer types, ensure that config.c is used

Thursday, April 3:
    * Check which configs are not being used anywhere algorithmically
        * implement the ones not being used

AND YOU SHOULD BE DONE??
